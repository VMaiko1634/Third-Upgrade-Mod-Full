1. Independent Dwellings Upgrades

You can now upgrade dwellings independently, level 1-6 units can be upgraded a third time and level 7 can be upgraded a fourth time, considered a "Level 8 Upgrade".

Note, that the right-clicking on the town hall doesn't disable the town destroying feature. However, when it is not needed, the standard text will not be shown. 
It will 'return' if you build a capitol or destroy the fort - then you'll see the standard text after you click on the 'OK' button. If you completely destroy a town, the new structure will be destroyed as well.

3. Creature Specialization

Heroes who specialize in creatures have the following scaling:

Attack/Defense: +1 Att/Def for every 7 hero levels
Damage: HeroLvl:Value(based on creature level)
Health: 9%+1*HeroLvL 

This bonus is added to the creatures only in combat! The normal Heroes3 mechanic (+1 Speed and +Att/Def after each x-level) still works and can be seen directly on your creature in the hero screen.
You will find this scaling much fairer then the busted WoG script, where each creature ended with +50 Att/Def after enough hero levels. 
If you are no fan of this script you can just delete the "Creature Specialisation Third Upgrade Mod" and "81 wog - disable options" erm file in the Data/s folder. 

4. Necromancy

Thanks to amethyst, something that has been asked for so much is now possible and it is necromancy compatibility with Third Upgrades Mod.
Necromancy has now been adapted and works as follows:

Basic Necromancy: Raise Skeletons
Advanced Necromancy: Raise Skeleton Warriors
Expert Necromancy: Raise Skeleton Knights

Cloak of the Undead King has also been made compatible with Third Upgrades Mod and Necromancy:

Basic Necromancy: Raise Ghouls
Advanced necromancy: Raise Ghosts
Necromancy Expert: Raise King Liches

5. Additional Units

Now it is possible to obtain additional units in the game, to obtain it there are 2 requirements, 
You are required to build a dwelling of the same level as the same creature (For example to build Treehouse you need to build Enchaing Spring) and build an exclusive building for each faction.
To obtain the upgraded version of the additional unit it is required that the building to obtain a third upgrade be built.
